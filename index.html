        <h1>GAN LIN</h1>
        <p>I am a third year New Media Design major at Rochester Institute of Technology whose main focus is on visual design. I  believe design is creative problem solving that involve communication to audiences. I have an immersion in Advertising and Public Relations. I probably won't get a minor, althought I tried to apply to multiple minors in my freshman year. I like to shoot landscape photo with my phone during free time. I like to make origami occasionally to reduce stress. I am now picking up the html/css skills I've lost over the previous years.</p>
